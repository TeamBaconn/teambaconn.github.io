&lt;p>This topic isn’t new. When I first learned about &lt;code>State Tree&lt;/code>, it was introduced as something that could be used not just for AI, but for many other systems — doors, crates, quests, game logic, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For AI, its use is quite straightforward. But when I thought about applying State Tree to other systems, I honestly couldn’t see how it would make sense. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>🚪 &lt;strong>Door system&lt;/strong>: You only need a simple boolean or enum to represent the door state. Using a full State Tree feels like overkill.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>🎯 &lt;strong>Quest system&lt;/strong>: Most quests I’ve seen are relatively simple (or maybe I’m just a normie) — &lt;em>kill 10 frogs, open 10 chests, talk to NPC A to retrieve item B&lt;/em>. State Tree’s functionality seems way too powerful for that.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>✅ And I was right — for simple mechanics where you just need something quick, there’s no need to use State Tree. It will probably waste more time dealing with the setup and complexity (trust me, it can be a headache).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[Unreal] External Knowledge</title><link>https://teambaconn.github.io/unreal-post/external-resources/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 16:37:58 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://teambaconn.github.io/unreal-post/external-resources/</guid><description>A collection of valuable resources for Unreal Engine developers, covering general knowledge, multiplayer, GAS, and advanced debugging tools</description></item><item><title>[Unreal] Animation Driven System</title><link>https://teambaconn.github.io/unreal-post/animation-driven/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 17:19:13 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://teambaconn.github.io/unreal-post/animation-driven/</guid><description>A general overview of animation-driven systems in game development, along with practical tips and implementation strategies for building them using GAS.</description></item><item><title>[Unreal] Using Gameplay Tags with GAS</title><link>https://teambaconn.github.io/unreal-post/gameplay-tag/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 21:49:26 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://teambaconn.github.io/unreal-post/gameplay-tag/</guid><description>Gotcha tips you might not know when using Gameplay Tags with GAS</description></item></channel></rss>
