### üß∞ Debugging Tip:
Paste the following lines into Rider‚Äôs variable watcher (exclude the comments) for quick insights during breakpoints:

```cpp
// Check if the breakpoint is on the client or server
{,,UnrealEditor-Engine.dll}::GPlayInEditorContextString

// Display the current frame count
{,,UnrealEditor-Core.dll}::GFrameCounter

// View the current game configuration
{,,UnrealEditor-Core.dll}::GConfig
```
