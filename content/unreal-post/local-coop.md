title = 'Local Coop'

It has been a while since I wrote a blog. I'm focusing on developing my game Project Brawl - a beat 'em up local coop / multiplayer game. And guess what?
Just like the title, I have a lot of troubles dealing with splitscreen multiplayer even if Unreal has already built a very good system supporting it. Like
every tutorial videos on Youtube: "You just need to go into the Project Setting, enable Use Splitscreen and use the function Create Local Player". What happen after
that? How to properly manage it? Are there any bugs that we need to aware of? None. And I thought to myself, wow local multiplayer is SUPER EASY. LETS DO IT NOW.
And it takes me weeks. Just to implement what Unreal "already supported" feature. Now you don't have to do that. At least I will try to shorten your time to get
your game "local-coop" qualified :D.
